I'm Pramesh and I am a Ph.D. student in computer science at the University of Central Florida. I'm currently researching applications of positional Burrows-Wheeler Transform (PBWT) in the field of population genetics with a slight inclination towards the study of admixture. If you're interested in my research, you can access it [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JTGtwW8AAAAJ&hl=en). 

I love all things algorithms and programming.
 ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the basic use of the SFML library to make some rudimentary games on the side (because who doesn't like games).
