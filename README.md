I'm Pramesh and I'm a Ph.D. student in computer science at the University of Central Florida. I'm currently researching applications of positional Burrows-Wheeler Transform (PBWT) in the field of population genetics with a slight inclination towards the study of admixture. I love all things algorithms and programming.

 🌱 I’m currently learning the basic use of the SFML library to make some rudimentary games on the side (because who doesn't like games?).
